### TogethDAO

This is my award-winning project from the ETH Shanghai Hackathon during my university years, where I was primarily responsible for developing smart contracts and handling cross-chain operations, as well as interfacing with NFT Marketplaces. The purpose of this application is to crowdfund on various chains and then cross-chain to Ethereum to purchase NFTs. The goal is to share the high gas costs of Ethereum among users and to allow more people the opportunity to invest in high-value NFTs.
