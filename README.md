# Welcome to my Soul Script!

_<mark style="background-color:red;">If you've been directed to this webpage to find my resume, you're in the right place! While this isn't a traditional resume, it contains all the information you need, presented in a vivid and interactive format. I hope you enjoy exploring it. For a more concise version of my resume, please visit the next page.</mark>_

My name is Zhang Lei. Inspired by [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9\_Descartes), I began my research journey with an interest in algebraic geometry at the age of seven. In honor of him, I also use '[descartes](https://github.com/descartes100)' as my developer name.

I am a [researcher](define-myself-as/researcher.md), a [developer](define-myself-as/developer.md), and an amateur [philosopher](define-myself-as/philosopher.md). My academic background encompasses [mathematics](my-knowledge-base/academic-foundations/mathematics.md), [computer science](my-knowledge-base/academic-foundations/computer-science.md), and [finance](my-knowledge-base/academic-foundations/finance.md). Professionally, I have gained experience at [Neo](https://neo.org/), [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), and [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/).

I believe that we are all shaped by our experiences—those that reach us from the outside and those that stir within us. The interplay between internal motivations and external influences crafts our holistic being, molding the essence of who we are. I call this interwoven process the "Soul Script."

This website serves as my own "Soul Script," a place where I document and share the continuous scripting of my soul through both the spiritual and physical realms. My decision to start this public GitBook stems from a desire to better present myself for my long-term career as a scholar and in the short term, to support my PhD application.
