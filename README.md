My name is Zhang Lei. Inspired by [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9\_Descartes), I began my research journey with an interest in algebraic geometry at the age of seven. In honor of him, I also use 'descartes' as my developer name.&#x20;

I am a [researcher](define-myself-as/researcher.md), a [developer](define-myself-as/developer.md), and an amateur [philosopher](define-myself-as/philosopher.md). My academic background encompasses [mathematics](my-knowledge-base/academic-foundations/mathematics.md), [computer science](my-knowledge-base/academic-foundations/computer-science.md), and [finance](my-knowledge-base/academic-foundations/finance.md). Professionally, I have gained experience at [Neo](https://neo.org/), [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), and [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/).

I believe that we are all shaped by our experiences—those that reach us from the outside and those that stir within us. It's relatively straightforward to trace someone’s external path: their hometown, alma mater, employers, and community engagements. Yet, the internal journey—how we develop our values and beliefs and how these evolve—is far more elusive and complex. The interplay between internal motivations and external influences crafts our holistic being, molding the essence of who we are. I call this interwoven process the "Soul Script."

This website serves as my own "Soul Script," a place where I document and share the continuous scripting of my soul through both the spiritual and physical realms.
