# Welcome to my Soul Script!

_<mark style="background-color:red;">If you've been directed to this webpage to find my resume, you're in the right place! While this isn't a traditional resume, it contains all the information you need, presented in a vivid and interactive format. I hope you enjoy exploring it. For a more concise version of my resume, please visit the next page.</mark>_

My name is Zhang Lei. In honor of [Ren√© Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9\_Descartes), I also use '[descartes](https://github.com/descartes100)' as my developer name.

I am a [researcher](define-myself-as/researcher.md), a [developer](define-myself-as/developer.md), and an amateur [philosopher](define-myself-as/philosopher.md). My academic background encompasses [mathematics](my-knowledge-base/academic-foundations/mathematics.md), [computer science](my-knowledge-base/academic-foundations/computer-science.md), and [finance](my-knowledge-base/academic-foundations/finance.md). Professionally, I have gained experience at [Neo](https://neo.org/), [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), and [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/).

This website serves as my own "Soul Script," a place where I document and share the continuous scripting of my soul through both the spiritual and physical realms. My decision to start this public GitBook stems from a desire to better present myself for my long-term career as a scholar and in the short term, to support my PhD application.
